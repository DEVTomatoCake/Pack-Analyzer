## Credits

Inspired by [ErrorCraft's FunctionAnalyser](https://github.com/ErrorCraft/FunctionAnalyser) - this is basically the same, but written in JavaScript and with more features.

Uses [misode's mcmeta](https://github.com/misode/mcmeta) for Minecraft version data.

Developed mostly by [TomatoCake](https://github.com/DEVTomatoCake).

## Note on v1
v1 used Tauri to make this app installable on Windows - this is annoying and scary, especially for one-time use.

As such, v2+ instead uses [a website](https://pack-analyzer.pages.dev/), with almost the same code. You're now able to install it as a [Progressive Web App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app).
